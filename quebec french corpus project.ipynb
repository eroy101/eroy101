    "### Introduction: \n",
    "\n",
    "This project analyzes the usage of swear words from those speaking Quebec french. It uses the [conversational Quebec french corpus](https://syllabo.speechneurolab.ca/) for analysis. In general, swear words in Quebec were derived from their anger against the Catholic Church. As a way to protest them, the people started taking sacred words from the Church and using them as swear words. This project is interested in learning about how often these swear words are used in conversations between Quebec french speaking persons. The list contains Quebec french swear words, as well as traditional french swear words. This is to see if whether Quebec french swear words are more common when compared to tradtional french swear words. The data is also split up by age to further analyze which age groups are cursing more, as well as if the age groups are split in terms of which swear words they're using. Further analysis can be done via sentiment dictonaries or new corpus separations via gender and educational level. "
